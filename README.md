# public_pymomapf
This repo contains the Python implementation of algorithms (NAMOA*, MOM*, MO-CBS) related to a multi-objective multi-agent path finding (MOMAPF) problem.
The main purpose of the code is to illustrate and verify the algorithm, and is not optimized for performance.
Script run_example.py can serve as an entry point to the planners.
This repository is no more maintained and is not recommended for usage. This repository is now superseded by a more recent [C++ implementation](https://github.com/wonderren/public_cppmomapf).
