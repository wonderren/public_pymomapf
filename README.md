This repo contains the Python implementation of algorithms related to a multi-objective multi-agent path finding (MOMAPF) problem.
The main purpose of the code is to illustrate and verify the algorithm, and is not optimized for performance.
Script run_example.py can serve as an entry point to the code.
Feel free to use the code for research purposes.
This repo is still under construction and more contents will be added.
